- Backend: Spring Boot 3.2.1, Java 17, Spring Security + JWT (jjwt 0.12.3), Spring Data JPA
- Database: H2 (development), switchable to MySQL/PostgreSQL; MySQL connector runtime
- Build: Maven with Spring Boot plugin; Windows batch helpers (build.bat, run.bat)
- PDF: iText 8.0.2
- Frontend: Static HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript served by Spring Boot
- Optional Service: Python Flask chatbot on port 5000 (separate process)
- Spring Boot hosts REST APIs and serves the static UI on port 8080; the UI uses fetch calls with Bearer tokens to access protected endpoints per role, enforced by Spring Security and the JWT filter.
- JPA persists domain entities to the configured DB; H2 is preferred during development for speed, while MySQL can be used for persistence.
- iText creates PDFs from domain data, saved to configured paths for download from dashboards.
- The chatbot widget calls a Java proxy endpoint, which forwards to the Flask service on port 5000; if Flask is offline, the UI indicates service unavailability.
- Maven orchestrates builds and runs; batch scripts simplify Windows usage.
